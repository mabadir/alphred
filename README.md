# Alphred for Alfred 2 Workflow

Alphred is a Distraction-free Alfred 2 posting Workflow, so you can just post your thoughts to [App.net] without launching any apps, and while running any other application. Simply type _adn_ followed by your post.

## How to Use Alphred

### Installation

- Download Alphred.
- Open the workflow file, to install it directly to Alfred 2 (*Powerpack license is required for Workflows*).

### Authentication

- Alphred needs to be authenticated the first time only, or if the token is revoked from the App.net settings.
- To authenitcate Alphred, run the following command into Alfred 2:
	`adnauth user:<username> pass:<password>`
- Where `<username>` us App.net username and `<password>` is the equivalent password.
- App.net had introduced the *Two Factor Authentication* for increased security. If you had this enabled for your profile, then you need to use an *App-specific* password for `<password>`.
- Alphred should send a notification to confirm that it is now authenticated and ready.
- All set! Let's have fun.

### Usage

#### Posting

- To post to App.net, all you have to do is to launch Alfred and then type:
	`adn <post>`
- `<post>` represents what you need to say to App.net. Simple isn't it.
